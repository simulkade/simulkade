- 👋 Hi, I’m Ali Eftekhari. My github name is @simulkade, a combination of 'simul' from simulation and 'kade' that -in both Persian and Dutch- refers to a place. My research philosophy is summarized as: 1- work hard to afford to be lazy (i.e. simplify and automate); and 2- any answer is better than no answer.
- 👀 I’m interested in reactive transport, energy and environmental analysis, and [classic] thermodynamics, not necessarily in that order.
- 🌱 I’m currently working as a Senior Researcher at the Technical University of Denmark where I supervise PhD students and develop mathematical models and numerical tools for different geoenergy applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing numerical tools for solving systems of differential equations  for the simulation of -among others- reactive transport and thermodynamic assessment of processes.
- 📫 You can reach me here on github, or send me an email. Find my contact information at my [DTU profile](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/ali-a-eftekhari)
