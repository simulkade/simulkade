- 👋 Hi, I’m Ali Eftekhari. My github name is @simulkade, a combination of 'simul' from simulation and 'kade' that -in both Persian and Dutch languages- refers to a place.
- 👀 I’m interested in transport phenomena in porous media, surface chemistry, and energy analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently working as a Researcher at Technical University of Denmark
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing numerical tools for the simulation of multiphase reactive flow in porous media
- 📫 You can reach me here on github, or send me an email. Find my contact information at my [DTU profile](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/ali-a-eftekhari)
